# Blake Corbit

Technical manager and automation builder at [AutoVitals](https://www.autovitals.com/) — a B2B SaaS platform serving 200+ automotive client installations.

I build the internal tooling and automation my team operates on. Python pipelines, Node.js platforms, PowerShell diagnostic toolkits. When I started, the team was 7 people doing manual work. I wrote the automation that let 3 people handle the same load.

## What I'm Building

- **12-service internal platform** (Node.js) — operations dashboard, AI-powered ticket triage, automated incident detection, integrations across Zendesk, Jira, Slack, Twilio, Mailgun, StatusPage
- **AI-powered processing pipeline** (Python, OpenAI API) — automated ticket classification, routing, and response generation
- **Diagnostic toolkits** (PowerShell) — distributed system troubleshooting across 200+ client installations
